# üìò Marks & Components ‚Äì Detailed Feature Specification

## üß≠ Overview
This module handles the uploading, editing, viewing, and auto-calculation of internal assessment and practical marks. Marks are stored component-wise and mapped to subject categories. Final scores are derived from uploaded components.

---

## ‚úÖ Functional Behavior
- Faculty can upload marks for only the subjects assigned to them
- Marks are uploaded using Excel templates or entered manually
- Components are auto-generated based on subject category (IPCC, PCC, etc.)
- Final marks are computed automatically using weighted logic
- Faculty can edit marks any time until results are finalized
- Dept Admins can override default component templates if needed

## üß© IA Question Configuration (CIE I, CIE II)
Faculty must configure each IA structure before entering marks:

### Configuration Fields:
- Total number of questions (e.g., Q1‚ÄìQ4)
- Subparts per question (e.g., Q1 ‚Üí 1a, 1b, 1c)
- Maximum marks per subpart (e.g., 1a = 5, 1b = 5, 1c = 5)
- Define Part A (e.g., Q1 & Q2), Part B (e.g., Q3 & Q4)
- Minimum required questions to attempt (e.g., 1 from Part A and 1 from Part B)

### Behavior:
- System generates dynamic Excel template or form based on configuration
- Total marks per student auto-calculated from answered subparts
- Manual override allowed for exceptional cases

---

## üìù Assignment Marks Configuration
- Faculty can configure number of assignments (e.g., Assignment 1, Assignment 2)
- Max marks can be assigned to each assignment independently
- Assignments can be configured before marks upload or entry
- Final assignment component score = sum of all configured assignments
- Editable after creation, but logs should track changes

## üìä Marks Auto-Calculation Logic
- **Final Marks** = Weighted sum of component marks
- Weightage per component is derived from the default template unless overridden
- No manual entry of final marks required
- Auto-validation to ensure max marks are not exceeded

---

## üìÅ Excel Upload Template Format
- Structure:
```
usn | name | subject_code | 1a | 1b | 1c | 2a | 2b | 2c | 3a | 3b | 3c | 4a | 4b | 4c | cie_1_total | assignment | lab_record | lab_cie | total
```
- One student per row
- Validations:
  - USN must exist and be mapped
  - Subject must be assigned to uploading faculty
  - Component values must not exceed configured max marks

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Manual Entry / Edit Interface
- Dropdowns for Subject, Section, Semester, and Component (e.g., CIE I, Assignment)
- If CIE I/II is selected and not yet configured:
  - Prompt for IA structure: number of questions, subparts, and max marks per subpart
  - Define Part A and Part B logic with minimum answer constraints

### Entry Table View
| USN | Name | 1a | 1b | 1c | Q1 Total | 2a | 2b | Q2 Total | Assignment | Lab CIE | Final |
|-----|------|----|----|----|----------|----|----|----------|------------|---------|--------|
- Individual subpart entry fields (auto-validated)
- Auto-calculated totals for each question and final marks
- Highlight missing values or over-limit entries
- Tooltips with max marks per field
- Color-coded feedback (green for complete, red for errors)

### Edit Mode
- Accessible per student or per component
- Inline table editing or modal view
- Shows original entry, current value, and timestamp of update
- All changes saved with faculty identifier for audit

### Actions
- üíæ Save & Calculate
- üì§ Upload from Excel
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download Excel template
- üìä Preview subject-wide totals and performance distribution

---

## üéì Marks Display for Students
### Student View UI
- Dashboard with per-semester tab (e.g., Semester 3, Semester 4)
- Each tab shows card or table layout:

| Subject Code | Subject Name | CIE I | CIE II | Assignment | Lab CIE | Total |
|--------------|---------------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|--------|

- Hover tooltips show detailed breakdown
- Color-coded status (e.g., green for high scores, red for low scores)
- Mobile-first responsive view with expandable subject cards
- Summary bar per semester (e.g., Total Avg, Top 3 scores, Lowest score)

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Role-Based Access

### View Logic:
- **Students**: Can only see their own marks per subject via the per-semester dashboard
- **Faculty**: Can view and edit marks of all students for the subjects assigned to them
- **Dept Admin**: Can view, filter, and download full department-wide student marks
- All views support filters by subject, section, semester, and scoring range
| Role         | Permissions |
|--------------|-------------|
| Faculty      | Upload/edit marks only for mapped subjects |
| Dept Admin   | View/export all department marks, manage templates |
| Super Admin  | Full access |
| Student      | View final marks only (per subject) |
